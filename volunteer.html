        >The Ocean Cleanup</a
      >
      is a place where either you could donate to or help clean up the ocean.
      Volunteering would help them have more people to clean up the ocean
      pollution, but many people who are not living near the ocean could donate.
      The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization, is developing and scaling
      technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic. Our aim is to put
      ourselves out of business once the oceans are clean.
